# ✨ Magic Squares Solver

## 🧩 Introduction

A **Magic Square** is an `n x n` grid filled with distinct integers such that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same.  
This repository contains Python code to generate and solve magic squares using two solver options.  
> ⚠️ **Note**: Solver option 2 requires **IBM CPLEX** to be installed on your machine.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 **Customizable Size (n)**: Specify the size (`n x n`) of the magic square.
- 🔁 **Initial Integer (i)**: Choose the starting integer for the series of consecutive numbers.
- 🧠 **Solver Selection (s)**: Select which solver to use for solving the linear program:
  - `1`: Native Python solver
  - `2`: IBM CPLEX (must be installed separately)

## 🛠️ Usage Example

To use the magic square solver, provide:
1. 📏 The size of the magic square
2. 🔢 The initial integer in the series
3. 🧠 The solver to be used (`1` or `2`)
