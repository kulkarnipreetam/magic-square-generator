# Magic Squares Solver

## Introduction

A **Magic Square** is an n x n grid filled with distinct integers in such a way that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. This repository contains code that allows you to generate and solve magic squares using different two solvers. (Your PC needs to have cplex to use it this option)

## Features

- **Customizable Size (n)**: Specify the size (n x n) of the magic square.
- **Initial Integer (i)**: Choose the initial integer to start the series of consecutive integers.
- **Solver Selection (s)**: Select from various solvers to solve the linear programming problem to generate the magic square.

## Usage example

To use the magic square solver, you need to provide:
1. The size of the magic square.
2. The initial integer in the series of consecutive integers.
3. The solver to be used for solving the linear program.(Your PC needs to have cplex to use it this option)

### Example

> Magic_Square_M(4,2,1)
